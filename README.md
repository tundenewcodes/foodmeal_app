# the foodmeal app
## this app is  basically my best project so far with the react technology i can say.

### everything i have ever learnt was put into use. the react hooks, form validation, pagination, react-router,redux and so on


##the app is very simple to use. i can say it is an improved version of my burger meal app.


###the foolmeal app has an array of available food items and their respective prices.
### users are to check through the list of the the available food and buy according to their taste and pocket size

### there is a cart component that updates the amount of food item you are buying. when you open the cart component use see all the details of your purchase.you can also add or remove from this food item here if you so desire..

### if you feel like continuing with the purchase their is a simple form to fill inorder to get info of buyers and ask for thier feedback if need be.
